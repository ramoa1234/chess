BOARDSQAURES NEEDS TO BE CLASS


rebuilding classes so that they take in correct parameters

try to get a piece on the board
and try to connect it a sqaure on the board
	sqaure class needs to be made so that each individual sqaure is an object
	-board than needs some kind of list like data structure that will store in
	where pieces are on board, and make it so that when a piece is on a square only the ones that have pieces can be
    seleceted and the square changes color to display that the piece color has changed

validMoves
create a new list that will store all pieces possible moves
	a temp list to pass in that will have validmove

I can make it so that a piecesColorValidMoves synces with the one already being used in main event loop and than sync so that I can be used to check the validMoves(2d list that synces with other list)(and than in valid moves check if the index of the selectd piece exist in the validMoves 2d list that will store all possible moves)
and update

error validMoves not a 2d list
need to pass in list into the list
