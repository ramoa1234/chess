BOARDSQAURES NEEDS TO BE CLASS


rebuilding classes so that they take in correct parameters

try to get a piece on the board
and try to connect it a sqaure on the board
	sqaure class needs to be made so that each individual sqaure is an object
	-board than needs some kind of list like data structure that will store in
	where pieces are on board, and make it so that when a piece is on a square only the ones that have pieces can be
    seleceted and the square changes color to display that the piece color has changed
